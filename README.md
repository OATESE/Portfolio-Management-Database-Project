# Financial Portfolio Management Database - CW1 Overview

## Project Summary

This database project is designed for to replicate a basic financial portfolio management system in a wealth or asset manegement firm that offers investement services for wealthy individuals. The system is a basic yet robust platform for managing client information, investment portfolios, financial assets, and their associated positions. The written python scripts facilitate various user interactions including viewing portfolio performance, updating client details, and managing investment positions.

## Background
In the realm of financial services portfolio management is a critical activity that involves maintaining and balancing investments to achieve optimal returns. However it is important that different clients for an investement firm will have different risk tolerance and investent aimns. While it would seem to make the most sense for the all of the firms financial advisors to advise to ojust select the one best preforming portfolio manager and then the firm effectivley manages one fund, individual investors will want to diversify their investements in different ways and will have different risk tolerances and thus there is a need to have several portfolios even multiple for a single client.

This project also aims to develop my understanding of database management systems and best practice. 



The CW1 database schema is an integral part of the system that:
- **Manages Clients**: Keeps track of client profiles, including contact details, allowing for personalization and better client relationship management.
- **Handles Portfolios**: Associates clients with their respective investment portfolios, detailing the composition and intention of each investment strategy.
- **Tracks Asset Positions**: Monitors individual assets within portfolios, capturing purchase dates, quantities, and prices to reflect real-time value.
- **Records Price History**: Maintains historical price data for a variety of assets, enabling performance analysis over any given period.
- **Ensures Data Integrity**: Implements constraints and foreign keys to maintain data consistency, accuracy, and reliability across the database.
- **Facilitates Reporting**: Via views and stored procedures, the schema supports the generation of detailed reports, such as portfolio performance and asset allocation over time.

The database schema is made to cater to the needs of financial advisors, portfolio managers, system administrators, and clients. It aims to support an environment where strategic investment decisions are informed by accurate and timely data.
