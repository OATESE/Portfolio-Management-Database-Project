# BEM2040_Template
This is a template repository for the BEM2040 Database Technologies for Business Analysts module.

## Folders
There are three folders in this repository.  
1.  Models
    This folder should contain your ERD and normalisation files.

2.  Python Files
    This folder should contain all python files that will demonstrate the business logic for your database project.

3.  SQL Files
    This folder should contain a backup of your database.  These are expected to be the DDL files that can be exported from your database as "Script As Create".  Ensure you include all tables, views, stored procedures and triggers.

## Instructions
Prior to submission you must edit this README file so that it shows clearly the information about your database project.  Delete the information provided here and replace with your own.

You must place a description of your database project here.  Provide a summary of the project, what is the background to it.  Ensure this is detailed enough to communicate to somebody who is not a domain expert what they should expect this database schema to provide.

Place links to your folders and edit the README files in the folders to explain what the files contain.
